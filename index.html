    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h4>Hello! My name is Ibrahim Abdullah Giyant, and I’m 15 years old. I currently live in Semarang, a beautiful city in Indonesia. I study at NUSA Boarding School, a place where I’m not only focused on academics but also on personal growth, discipline, and building strong character.</h4>
    <h4>One of my biggest passions is sports. I love playing football, basketball, and volleyball. Recently, I’ve also developed a deep interest in calisthenics—a bodyweight training method that challenges both strength and control. Sports help me stay active, focused, and they’ve taught me about teamwork, persistence, and leadership
    <h4>Besides sports, I enjoy playing video games, whether it’s on PC or mobile. Games are not just a way to relax—they also help me think strategically, solve problems, and sometimes even connect with new friends from around the world. Gaming has become one of my favorite hobbies outside of school and training.

I have a few people I truly admire. Chico Lachowski, a successful model with a strong and humble personality, is one of my inspirations. I also look up to David Laid, a fitness icon who motivates me to keep pushing my physical limits. Most importantly, my greatest role model is Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), whose wisdom, character, and compassion guide how I try to live my life every day.
<h3>Thank you for taking the time to get to know me. I’m always striving to become a better version of myself—in school, in sports, and in life.</h3>
